I created a website for a fictional Rafting Company as part of my Web Fundamentals class using HTML and CSS. 

The website contains four different pages: 
• Home: Introduction to the company

• About Us: Information about the company’s mission and history

• Trips: Information about available rafting trips including duration, difficulty level, price and maximum group size

• Contact Us: Contact information and a structured form layout.
